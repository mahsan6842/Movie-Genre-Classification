Features:

Clean and preprocess movie descriptions using regular expressions

Transform text using TF-IDF vectorization (with unigrams and bigrams)

Train a Multinomial Naive Bayes model

Save and load the trained model/vectorizer using pickle or joblib

Interactive web interface using Flask

Expose the app online using ngrok

Dataset:

The dataset used is publicly available on Kaggle:
